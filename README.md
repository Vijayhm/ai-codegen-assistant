# üß† AI-Powered Code Generation and Enhancement System

A local AI assistant designed to streamline software development through automatic code generation, debugging, and testing using open-source large language models (LLMs) like Meta‚Äôs LLaMA 3, DeepSeek, and Mistral.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This tool acts as a personal software engineer assistant that:

- Generates, modifies, and tests code using natural language instructions.
- Fine-tunes open-source LLMs on company-specific codebases.
- Automates test case generation and execution.
- Maintains code quality and aligns with company conventions.
- Ensures local, secure, and private AI integration.
